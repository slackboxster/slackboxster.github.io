title: Why I hate PHP
---
I'm not a big fan of PHP for various reasons that I will probably eventually write up. And I know, you will probably remind me that they are making wonderful improvements in like version 7, but seriously, I'll get excited about that when web servers actually run the version of PHP that has all the cool features. Until then, I'm stuck with writing junky code because the entire web development industry thought it a good idea to standardise on a templating language that has been hacked into something that is supposed to resemble a real programming language.

Here are my reasons:
1. No method overloading!
2. I have spent much of the last six months programming in [Groovy](http://www.groovy-lang.org/). Once you've used a truly capable language like this, there is no going back.
3. More to come at some point. If I ever care.

Also, a related note is why I hate javascript. For at least a similar reason to (2), and a number of others. I tend to agree with others I've read -- javascript isn't a language, it's bytecode...
