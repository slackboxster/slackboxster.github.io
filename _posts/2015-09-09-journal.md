Removing database passwords from two commits back (if you are allowed to force push. if not, you will likely need to delete the remote branch):

    git checkout <commit before passwords>
    #now in detached head state
    git checkout -b <temp branch>
    #create a branch on which to do fixies.
    git cherry pick -n <commit with passwords>
    #now to remove the files
    git reset HEAD grails-app/conf/Config.groovy
    git commit
    #add the modified and cherry picked commit back in, message will be preserved, but if you are not original author you will be now
    git reset --hard HEAD
    # get rid of the bad changes. could also stash.
    git cherry-pick <commits after password one>
    # do for each commit. there may be ways to do multiple at once, but I only had to pull in another two.
    git branch -D <branch-to-fix>
    # delete the branch. we will readd
    git checkout -b <branch-to-fix>
    #recreate the branch on the new one.
    git push origin <branch-to-fix>
    #confirm that it errors giving you crap about fast forward
    git push -f origin <branch-to-fix>
    #push with force, will overwrite the existing branch if you have permissions to. otherwise delete the branch on your remote and push.
    git branch -D <temp branch>
    #delete your temp branch, as you have renamed the fix branch over it.
