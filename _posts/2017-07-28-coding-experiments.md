title: New Section: Experiments
---

I've added a new section to my site for coding experiments. Mostly these are just random html pages that I've thrown together to experiment with some strange and wonderful html thing. Head over to the [My Coding Experiments](/experiments) to see what I'm  talking about. The first one is a fun sliding bars experiment. But I'll hopefully add a couple more shortly.
