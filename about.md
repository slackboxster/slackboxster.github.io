title: About 
---

I am a human. My trade is (polyglot/full stack/cloud native) software development. I love writing clean code to solve complex business problems. My passion is teaching others what I've learned, and gaining a deep and concrete understanding of the tools of my trade.

I currently work as a Software Engineer at [Deloitte](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en.html). I've also worked for [CloudCard](https://onlinephotosubmission.com/) and [SharpTop Co](http://sharptop.io/).

I think a lot about the nature of software, and the implications this has on how it is built, managed and maintained.

This site collects my deep thoughts, learnings, and teachings on the art of software development.
