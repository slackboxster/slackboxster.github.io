I am an engineer at [SharpTop Co](http://www.sharptop.co). I am passionate about building quality software products, using great tools in my work, understanding the economics and philosophy of my work, and passing on all of what I have learned to the next generation.

This site records some of the many profound and deep brain things going on inside my head. If you care to explore that region of the known universe, stick around.
