Welcome to the Build It Yourself Project (BIYP). This is a collection of computer science assignments that require you to build some complex piece of the computer science world on your own, from basic components. Through this process, you gain a deep, concrete understanding of what otherwise seems like incomprehensible magic. In turn, this deep understanding enables you to build and debug complex systems that interact with other tools that, apart from building them yourself, you would never be able to understand.

This project is very much a work in progress. To start with, it's basically a bunch of links. But my long term goal is that this becomes a computer science curriculum, and that you could get the equivalent of a top notch CS degree simply by going through most of the assignments in this course.

Why would I build something like this, when there are great sites like [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/) and [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) that will help you learn to code? The simple reason is that I want something deeper - super in-depth. Perhaps inaccessible to the beginner. CodeWars is a really great tool that I love to use for learning new languages or sharpening my thinking skills. But it tends to be very heavy on math problems, rather than complex, almost magical, systems (e.g. web servers, SSL, browsers, containers, operating systems) that underpin our everyday computer usage. I don't want to create a math problem website. I want to create a place where you can learn about all of the systems that power our business and personal technology, and in the process, learn the Computer Science and Math theory that underpin everything.

This site is also not going to be explaining how to do something with existing tools. It's explaining how the existing tools work. So don't expect to find too much here about setting up SSL keys, or installing NginX on a server. Some assignments may use these tools to help take care of things we don't want to build directly. But overall, we'll be building our tools, not using other people's tools.
